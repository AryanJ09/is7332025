COVER LETTER 
Dear Dr. Basnyat,

I hope this finds you well. I am writing to express my keen interest in working as a Research Assistant
or Volunteer under your guidance. As a Masterâ€™s student in Information Systems at UMBC, with a strong background in
machine learning, AI, and data analytics, I am eager to contribute to your research efforts, particularly in computer vision 
and AI-driven problem-solving applications.
My academic and project experiences have strengthened my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data mining.
I have worked extensively with Python, SQL, and various AI/ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
My research on explainable AI in healthcare applications has deepened my understanding of real-world AI implementation,
making me particularly interested in your NSF-funded projects and research on Human-Wildlife Conflict using AI. Additionally,
my experience in backend development, database management, and cloud computing aligns well with the technological aspects of your work.

I am deeply inspired by your extensive contributions to AI/ML and your entrepreneurial ventures.
Working under your mentorship would provide a valuable opportunity to apply my skills in innovative research and gain deeper insights 
into AI applications. I would love to discuss how I can support your ongoing projects, whether through data analysis, model development, or 
research assistance.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet and discuss this further at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I look forward to your response.
